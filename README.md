### Hello :)

I use she/her/hers pronouns :)

#### Some things about me: 
I am a history major at the University of Oregon with a minor in digital humanities and I'm graduating in June 2023!! 

I love watching tv and am currently watching "Crash Course in Romance" on Netflix and my favorite shows are probably "New Girl" and "Fruits Basket" (I totally recommend all of these!!) I also love to knit, bake and spend time with my friends. Feel free to ask me questions about any of these things or for tv recommendations (I can legit talk about tv forever lol) :)
